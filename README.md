Fatcow Email Login
==================

A lot of times, I've found myself registering a domain + hosting account for my clients, and I always use [Fatcow](http://fatcow.com). After creating email accounts, there's always a need for a login page hosted on the site.

So here it is.

Demo: [http://classrebels.co/mail](http://classrebels.co/mail)

Usage
=====

Download the PHP version (index.php) with .css files and use the URL "index.php?site=example.com" or simply find and replace "classrebels.co" in the HTML version (index.html).

Code
====

It's just a pretty HTML form that sends a request to Fatcow's login checker and redirects you to your account.
